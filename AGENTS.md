# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# FoxPassport Republic App Rules

## 1. Git Branching and Work Safety

### 1. Inspect Before Editing
- Before making any changes, inspect `git status`, the current branch, and `git diff`.
- Check for uncommitted changes and understand whether they belong to the current task.
- Never discard, reset, clean, stash, or commit existing work without explicit authorization.

### 2. Dedicated Branches Are Mandatory
- Before implementing a new feature, bug fix, refactor, optimization, or other code change, create or switch to a dedicated task branch.
- Never develop directly on `main`, `master`, or a shared integration branch.
- Use descriptive branch names:
  - `feat/<short-description>` — new features
  - `fix/<short-description>` — bug fixes
  - `perf/<short-description>` — performance improvements
  - `refactor/<short-description>` — refactoring
  - `docs/<short-description>` — documentation
  - `test/<short-description>` — tests

### 3. Preserve Existing Work
- If the current branch contains unrelated uncommitted changes, do not automatically commit, stash, or move them.
- If the task can be safely isolated, create the task branch while preserving the existing working tree.
- If existing changes overlap with the requested task or their ownership is unclear, stop and ask for clarification before editing.
- Before switching branches, check whether doing so could carry uncommitted changes into another task.

### 4. Branch Creation and Checkpoints
- Check whether the intended branch already exists before creating it.
- If it exists, inspect its status and history before deciding whether to reuse it.
- Never reset or overwrite an existing branch to make it match a preferred starting point.
- For risky or multi-step changes, establish a recoverable baseline when the working tree is clean and it is safe to do so. Do not commit unrelated changes to create a checkpoint.

### 5. Completion
- Report the branch used in the task completion summary.
- Do not merge into protected or shared branches, push changes, or open a pull request unless requested or authorized by the project's workflow.

## 2. Rendering, Caching & Performance
- **Safe Caching Boundary**: Public catalog queries (venues, categories, templates, foxers) should use `publicServerFetch` with Next.js revalidation (`revalidate: 60/300`) and cache tags.
- **Strictly Dynamic Flows**: Booking, checkout, payment status, user profile, and creator dashboards must remain dynamic and un-cached.
